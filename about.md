Hi there, my name is Hieu Huynh. I am working as a data scientist/engineer at [eSmart Systems](https://www.esmartsystems.com/) 
in Norway. My daily work focuses on building various types of learning models and deploying them 
in a scalable and maintainable manner. 

My general interest is any idea and application that can leverage Machine Learning power and distributed computing to bring value
out of any kind of massive amount data. Recently I have extensively attention on chatbot and reinforcement learning with Tensorflow.

Learning is a long journey, the more we learn something the less we know about it. I started this blog as a place holder for my
 thoughts during that journey with purpose of no more than learning and sharing. 
 
 When I do not sit in front of some computer, you might find me in a swimming pool or some running route around Halden, Norway.
 Or easier, find me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hieuchuynh/).
